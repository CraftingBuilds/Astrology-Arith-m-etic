The directory, aka folder, titled ‘08. Further Exploration’ is meant to be a warehouse storing bits of information/knowledge that arise during my preparing and compiling the data for Astrology Arith(m)etic and its files/folders. 

The notes (files) created are meant to be like sticky notes for “hey! Wanna go check out this fact you found interesting???” If I have the leisure, or available, time to do so. (I suppose I could have simply stated if I have the time to do so then I wouldn’t be so caught up on wether to use leisure or available or some other descriptive jargain that pops into my brain demanding I hold space for it and that it gets its due on this masterpiece(🤞🤞(I’m hoping))) <- that’s a heck-of-a-lota parenthesis…

The to the point brief of this folder, any included su folders or the contents contained within are notes-for-self when Alice has time to travel through the rabbit hole.
