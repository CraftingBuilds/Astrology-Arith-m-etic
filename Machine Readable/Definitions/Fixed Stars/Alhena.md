## General Meaning:
Alhena is a bright white star marking the left foot of Pollux in the constellation Gemini. Known as “The Proudly Marching One,” it symbolizes purpose-driven movement, artistic clarity, and spiritual poise. Traditionally ruled by Mercury and Venus, Alhena combines intellect and creativity with a sense of destiny or soul mission.
