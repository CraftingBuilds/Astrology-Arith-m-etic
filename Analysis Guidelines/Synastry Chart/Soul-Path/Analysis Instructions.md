# Soul-Path Synastry Analysis Instructions

1. Compare both nodal axes to identify shared life lessons and collective evolution.
2. Examine aspects from one person's planets to the other's nodes, Vertex, or [[Midheaven]] for destiny cues.
3. Evaluate Saturn contacts for karmic responsibilities or agreements requiring mutual commitment.
4. Review overlays of the 9th and 12th houses to see how spiritual paths intersect.
5. Note progressions and significant transits that trigger nodal or Vertex connections for timing milestones.
6. Look for repeating themes with asteroids like [[Astrology Arith(m)etic - The Building Blocks of Astrology/Building Blocks/Celestial Bodies & Calculation Points/Asteroids/Chiron]] or [[Astrology Arith(m)etic - The Building Blocks of Astrology/Building Blocks/Celestial Bodies & Calculation Points/Asteroids/Pallas]] for guidance and wisdom.
7. Assess how each partner's strengths encourage the other's life mission and personal growth.
8. Summarize the relationship's role in propelling both individuals toward fulfilling their purpose.
